# 15 Puzzle Game

A terminal-based implementation of the classic **15 Puzzle** sliding tile game.

## Objective

Arrange the numbered tiles in order (1–15) by sliding them into the empty space.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys** – Move tiles into the empty space  
- **Esc** – Exit the game

## Compilation and Run

```bash
cd games/15puzzle
gcc -o 15puzzle game-15puzzle.c -lncurses
./15puzzle
````

## Example Board

```
 1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8
 9 10 11 12
13 15 14   
```

## Notes

* Requires **ncurses library** for terminal graphics.
* The board is shuffled randomly at the start of each game.

If you want, I can **also create a polished README for the root `c` repository**, linking all projects (`large-number-arithmetic`, `parallel-term-search`, `games`, etc.) in a **uniform, professional style** so the whole repo feels cohesive.  

Do you want me to do that next?
